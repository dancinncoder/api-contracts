# API contracts practice using axios

### Good point of using axios

The good point of using axios instead of fetch() is that you don't need to convert fetched data to json format. You can skip this process.

### How to?

1. install axios in terminal 'yarn add axios'
2. axios.get.then
3. add catch() for the case for an error
4. showing fetched data to screen using useState
5. connect response.data to data state
6. Add useEffect for stopping infinite re-rendering
